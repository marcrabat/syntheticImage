Some Information:
-------------------
	· We have mantained the same project structure as the previous Assignments.
	· We have been working both in Windows7-8 and Windows 10 versions with Visual Studio, so we have to make a little action when working separetely.
		In case of errors for opening the project, please try:
			Proyecto --> Redestinar Solución --> Current Windows Version
		This worked for us.
	· We have included a folder "outputs" in VisualStudio2015/RTIS_V2 which contain images when doing the project plus the final results.
	· We have stored our meshes in the folder VisualStudio2015/RTIS_V2/data/obj.
